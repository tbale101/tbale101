#Explaining about the Game amd Rules
print("""\n"Quizzare" is a multiple-choice quiz that is fully interactive.
To beat the game, you'll have to answer a series of questions correctly.
So your aim should be to score as many points as possible.
There's no timer, so take your time answering the questions.
The rules of "Quizzare" are simple:
Once a question is posted, you'll be given three options: a, b and c.
Use your judgement to select the correct answer. That means you can only choose a, b or c.
When entering your answer, ensure that you use a lowercase letter.
Take the following example:
Q1. Kilimanjaro, a mountain with three volcanic cones, is 5,895 m high.
Where is this impressive mountain located?
a. China
b. Tanzania
c. Brazil
If you feel c is the correct answer, when prompted, enter simply the letter c.""")
