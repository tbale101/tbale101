#creating while loop
c = 1#given value of c
while c <11:#c value less than 11
    print(c, 'My Computer World')#print the following statement
    if c == 3:#if c is equal to 3 
        print("c value is 3 now")#another messege comes after 3 times
        break#after 3 times stops
    c = c+1#icreasing c value eact time by 1
